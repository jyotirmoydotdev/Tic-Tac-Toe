Tic Tac Toe is a terminal game written in C++. The game allows two players to play against each other, taking turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row wins. The game is easy to play and a great way to pass the time.

# Usage

$ g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp -o main
$ ./main
```
